    "text": "Credit Risk Assessment & Predictive Modeling for Loan Approvals | Python, Jupyter November 2024 ‚Ä¢ Designed a risk assessment model analyzing 1,000+ loan records, boosting approval accuracy and cutting defaults by 15%. Built scalable data pipelines in Python. ‚Ä¢ Developed a predictive modeling framework analyzing loan data with Pandas/NumPy, improving approval accuracy by 12%. ‚Ä¢ Conducted correlation analysis with pandas.corr() to identify key repayment factors, informing a new credit scoring model. ‚Ä¢ Created visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn), of repayment trends, revealing 25% higher repayment for loans under $5,000, guiding a tiered interest rate strategy.\n*Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction** | MySQL, Python February 2025 ‚Ä¢ Designed and executed a comprehensive churn analysis on 50,000+ customer records, identifying key predictors and reducing churn by 8%. Leveraged SQL to develop scalable data models. ‚Ä¢ Developed a predictive framework utilizing queries, improving accuracy by 10% through the identification of high-risk customer segments. ‚Ä¢ Conducted in-depth data analysis using SQL joins, aggregations, and subqueries to uncover correlations between customer behavior, demographics, and churn. ‚Ä¢ Created data visualizations using SQL-generated insights, revealing a 30% higher churn rate among customers with low engagement, informing targeted retention strategies."

    "text": "I‚Äôm a currently a student at Cal State East Bay,majoring in Data Science with a minor in Computer Science. With one foot in the world of R and the other exploring Python and SQL, I‚Äôm trying to build a toolkit to turn messy data into meaningful insights\nMy path hasn‚Äôt been straight it‚Äôs more like a scatterplot with a general upward trend. I started in retail, picked up an interest in data, and now I‚Äôm exploring things like sleep habits, grad school admissions, and even the science behind cannabis. I like finding questions that make me curious and figuring them out with data..\nI‚Äôm also a PALiISaDS Scholar, working to bridge the gap between undergrad and grad-level research in data science.\n\nüê¶ Side interests: Space, plants, cats, digital culture, and learning how to teach myself better\nüõ†Ô∏è Currently building: Regression models, data visualizations, and confidence\nThis space is where I share projects, code experiments, and things I‚Äôm proud of. If you‚Äôre into creative questions, thoughtful data work, or just figuring things out in general, let‚Äôs connect!"
